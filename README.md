The Accessible Ukulele strives to eliminate the fine motor skills required to play the ukulele, to make playing music more accessible for amputees or those with fine motor control disabilities. The device allows the user to play chords at the press of a button using six precisely placed solenoids, that press down the strings of the ukulele.
